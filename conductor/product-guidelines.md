# Product Guidelines

## 1. Prose Style and Tone
- **Concise and Direct:** All technical documentation and VLM-generated descriptions must prioritize brevity and high-density keyword extraction.
- **RAG-Focused:** Content should be structured to provide maximal semantic value for Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems, avoiding filler words.

## 2. Document Standards (Markdown)
- **GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM):** The primary output format for all extracted content to ensure universal compatibility.
- **Standardized Math & Tables:**
    - Use clear LaTeX strings for all mathematical notations.
    - Normalize complex PDF tables into standard, clean Markdown grids.

## 3. Visual Identity & Debugging
- **Minimalist and Functional:** Annotated PDFs for layout verification should use thin borders and small, readable labels.
- **Unobtrusive Verification:** Ensure that annotations do not obscure the underlying document content, maintaining visual context for the developer.

## 4. Brand Messaging
- **Intelligent Extraction:** Position DDC as the essential bridge between static PDF pixels and semantic knowledge.
- **Vision-to-Markdown:** Emphasize the core value proposition of transforming visual documents into structured, machine-readable data.

## 5. Technical Documentation Standards
- **Component Clarity:** Each module (Layout, Enrichment, Orchestration) should have clear, keyword-dense READMEs.
- **Performance First:** Documentation should highlight optimization parameters (e.g., batch sizes, resolution tuning) to help users maximize efficiency.

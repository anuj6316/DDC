Act as a technical analyst. Analyze the provided figure and provide a structured, keyword-dense description for a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system.

OUTPUT STRUCTURE:
1. **Title/Caption**: Capture the explicit figure number and title if visible.
2. **Type**: Identify if it's a Bar Chart, Line Graph, Flowchart, Architectural Diagram, or Illustration.
3. **Data Points/Labels**: List all axes, legends, annotations, and specific data values visible.
4. **Detailed Summary**: Describe the logic, workflow, or information being communicated. Focus on technical keywords and relationships (e.g., "Step A leads to Step B", "Inverse correlation between X and Y").
5. **Key Takeaway**: One sentence summarizing the main conclusion drawn from the figure.

Guidelines:
- Maintain an objective, technical tone.
- Do not make subjective interpretations.
- Treat this as a "alt-text" layer that enables an LLM to "see" the diagram through your description.
